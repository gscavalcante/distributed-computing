 * Write a Java class that allows parallel search in an array of integer. It

 * 
 * `public static int parallelSearch(int x, int[] A , int numThreads)`
 * 
 * This method creates as many threads as specified by numThreads, divides the
 * array A into that many parts, and gives each thread a part of the array to
 * search for sequentially. If any thread finds x, then it returns an
 * index i such that A [i] = x. Otherwise, the method returns -1.
